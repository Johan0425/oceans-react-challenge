```

Or using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Or:

## API Documentation with Swagger

This project includes Swagger documentation to provide a clear and interactive interface for exploring the available APIs. To access the Swagger UI:

1. Start the application.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` in your browser.

The Swagger UI allows you to view all available endpoints, their request/response formats, and test them directly from the interface.

### Adding New Endpoints

To add new API endpoints, update the `swagger.json` file located in the `docs` directory. Follow the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) to define your endpoints.

## Usage

### Key Features

1. **Search and Filtering**: Use the search bar to find specific items or apply filters to narrow down results.
2. **Pagination**: Navigate through large datasets with ease using the built-in pagination controls.
3. **Interactive API Testing**: Use the Swagger UI to test API endpoints and view responses in real-time.
4. **Responsive Design**: Access the application on any device, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Workflow

1. Start the application using the instructions above.
2. Use the navigation menu to explore different sections of the app.
3. Interact with the features, such as searching, filtering, and viewing detailed information.

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues**: If you encounter issues with dependencies, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling:
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install
    ```
- **Docker Issues**: Ensure Docker is running and properly configured. Check for any errors in the Docker logs.
- **API Errors**: Verify that the backend API is running and accessible. Check the Swagger documentation for endpoint details.
